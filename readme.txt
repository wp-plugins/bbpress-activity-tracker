The cus­tomer sat­is­fac­tion score, or CSAT as it's often called, intends to mea­sure a customer's sat­is­fac­tion with the ser­vice received. It is a measure of how products and services supplied by a company meet or surpass customer expectation.

In its simplest form, CSAT is expressed as a per­cent­age between 0 and 100, with 100% rep­re­sent­ing com­plete cus­tomer sat­is­fac­tion. There can be a large vari­ance between the CSAT scores of com­pa­nies in a given indus­try, or at the same com­pany over time.
